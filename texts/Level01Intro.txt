This is a relatively simple Mission:
Get in and prepare the environment for our Units. 


You are a small Bean, you fit small Spaces. ('WASD' to move 'QE' to rotate camera)


Your hacking skills will come in handy in future missions, 
for now feel free to mess around a bit by opening doors using the Computer Terminals, 
like the abandoned one at reception, in rooms adjacent to the Doors. (Interact with 'F')
